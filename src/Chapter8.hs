8.9.1

In a similar manner to the function add, define a recursive multiplication function
mult :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat for the recursive type of natural numbers:
Hint: make use of add in your definition.

data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat
            deriving Show

nat2int :: Nat -> Int
nat2int Zero = 0
nat2int (Succ n) = 1 + nat2int n


int2nat :: Int -> Nat
int2nat 0 = Zero
int2nat n = Succ ( int2nat (n-1))

add :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
add Zero n = n
add (Succ m) n = Succ (add m n)

mult :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
mult Zero n = Zero
mult (Succ m) n = add n (mult m n)

8.9.2

Although not included in appendix B, the standard prelude defines

data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT

together with a function:

compare :: Ord a => a -> a -> Ordering

that decides if one value in an ordered type is less than (LT), equal to (EQ), or greater than (GT)
another value. Using this function, redefine the function:

occurs :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Bool 

for search trees. Why is this new definition more efficient than the original version?

8.9.3 

Consider the following type of binary trees:
data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)

Let us say that such a tree is balanced if the number of leaves in the left and right subtree of every
node differs by at most one, with leaves themselves being trivially balanced. Define a function
balanced :: Tree a -> Bool that decides if a binary tree is balanced or not.

Hint: first define a function that returns the number of leaves in a tree.
