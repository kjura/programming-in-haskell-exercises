module Chapter5 where

----------------------------------------

--Exercise 1
-- Using a list comprehension, give an expression that calculates the sum
-- 1^2 + 2^2 + ... 100^2
-- Of the first one hundred integer squares


sqrs :: Int -> Int
sqrs n = sum [x^2 | x <- [1..n]]


--Exercise 2
-- Suppose that a coordinate grid of size m Ã— n is given by the list of all pairs (x, y) of integers such
-- that 0 <= m and 0 <= y <= n . Using a list comprehension, define a function grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int, Int)]
-- that returns a coordinate grid of a given size. For example:
-- grid 1 2 -> [(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)]


grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int, Int)]
grid a b = [(a, b) | a <- [0..a], b <- [0..b]]


--Exercise 3
-- Using a list comprehension and the function grid above , define  a function square :: Int -> [(Int, Int)]
-- that returns a coordinate square of size n, excluding the diagonal from (0, 0) to (n, n). For example:
-- square 2 -> [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)]

square :: Int -> [(Int, Int)]
square n = [(x, y) | (x, y) <- grid n n, x /= y]



-- Exercise 4
-- In a similar way to the function 'length', show how the library function replicate :: Int -> a -> [a]
-- that produces a list of identical elements can be defined using a list comprehension. For
-- example : replicate 3 True -> [True, True, True]

compReplicate :: Int -> a -> [a]
compReplicate n x = [x | _ <- [1..n]]


-- Exercise 5
-- A triple (x, y, z) of positive integers is Pythagorean if it satisfies the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2
-- Using a list comprehension with three generators, define a function pyths :: Int -> [(Int, Int, Int)]
-- that returns the list of all such triples whose components are at most a given limit. For example:
-- pyths 10 -> [(3,4,5),(4,3,5),(6,8,10),(8,6,10)]

pyths :: Int -> [(Int, Int, Int)]
pyths n = [(x, y, z) | x <- [1..n], y <- [1..n], z <- [1..n], x^2 + y^2 == z^2]


-- Exercise 6
-- A positive integer is perfect if it equals the sum of all of its factors, excluding the number itself.
-- Using a list comprehension and the function factors , define a function "perfects" :: Int -> [Int]
-- that returns the list of all perfect numbers up to a given limit. For example:
-- perfects 500 -> [6, 28, 496]


-- Supplementary function for factors
factors :: Int -> [Int]
factors n = [x | x <- [1..n-1], n `mod` x == 0]

-- 
perfects :: Int -> [Int]
perfects n = [x | x <- [1..n], sum (factors x) == x]



-- Exercise 7
-- Show how the list comprehension [(x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [3,4]] --> [(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4)] with two generators
-- can be re-expressed using two comprehensions with single generators. Hint: nest one
-- comprehension within the other and make use of the library function concat :: [[a]] -> [a].

twoGen :: Int -> Int -> [(Int, Int)]
twoGen x y = [(x, y) | x <- [1..x], y <- [3..y]]

--singGen :: Int -> Int -> [(Int, Int)]
--singGen x y = [ [x | x <- [1..x]] | y <- [3..y] ] 




-- Exercise 8
-- Redefine the function "positions" using the function "find"

positions :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [Int]
positions x xs = [i | (x', i) <- zip xs [0..], x == x']

find :: Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> [b]
find k t = [v | (k', v) <- t, k == k']


new_positions :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [Int]
new_positions x xs = undefined


-- Exercise 9
-- The scalar product of two lists of integers xs and ys
-- of length n is given by the sum of the products
-- of corresponding integers
-- In a similar manner to "chisqr", show how a list comprehension
-- can be used to define a function
-- scalarproduct :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int that returns the scalar
-- product of two lists. E.g scalar product [1,2,3] [4,5,6] -> 32 


scalarproduct :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int
scalarproduct xs ys = sum [a*b | (a,b) <- (zip xs ys)]
